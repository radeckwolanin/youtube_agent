piqued your imagination for this well when I first started he was the only person able to get American astronauts into orbit ever since the space shuttle had been decommissioned and he was doing more than anybody to bring us into the air of electric vehicles to create batteries to create solar roofs so I thought he was doing these epic missions of course in the middle after a year or so of reporting he decides to quietly start buying Twitter so it became much more of a roller coaster ride it also revealed both the drives that come in his head but the demons that are sometimes dark and sometimes he can channel into drives what did you go in thinking about him and what did you emerge I thought at first that he was a technologist who had a really good feel for manufacturing how to make factories also that he was a risk taker and man in this country in fact in all of the West we used to be more of a Risk Takers you know everybody who came to the United States came whether the Mayflower across the river Grand taking some risks but now we have more referees than we have Risk Takers you know we have more lawyers and Regulators than we have innovators and so I thought okay he's pushing things forward but I also got to see that that can be kind of dark at times that it can break things it can blow up rockets and then of course it can really disrupt Twitter so it's about it's a story about somebody who's a tightly woven fabric of light and dark strength and I wonder whether it's you know you talk about referees but one of the critics of critiques of musk is that he is such a powerful private wealthy individual that he can just walk around the world making policy you know replace facing NASA replacing the internet having a real role in an active War like in you know our internet generation in Ukraine I need to ask you because it's in the news how do you explain this discrepancy um regarding the starlink and the activation over the Ukraine attempt to take the war to Crimea in the early days he you said one thing in your book that he turned it off and he says another thing and you've had to walk it back about that that night that night when it was happening in September he said to me hey we've disabled and we're not enabling this attack because it could start World War III he was very apocalyptic he says we're not going to let him use starlink to do this sneak attack there and I made the mistake of thinking he meant that night he turned it off and later he said no it had already been disabled but the ukrainians all the text messages are in the book they're pretty amazing we're trying to get him to a neighbor because they did not know he had it disabled and so so I made a mistake in thinking that the decision to disable it was made that night it had been made before then it's called geo-fencing but it's still the main thing was he got to decide that night do the ukrainians get to do this attack or not do this attack so it doesn't affect that and it doesn't even affect the larger question is how come he got to decide why is a private citizen deciding well that was my ukrainians how is that even possible does that trouble you about somebody like musk well I think it even traveled musk after a while because he talks to General Mark Miller of the Joint Chiefs of Staff talks to Jake Sullivan the National Security advisor and they work out a deal where SpaceX must company will sell some of these satellites to the U.S military and the U.S military gets it aside and that's really the way it should be but there's a larger question here which is how come when the Russians attacked Ukraine all of the US military satellites via set everybody else doing Communications gets knocked out and the only person in the world who has a communication system that can work is musk and it's still the case and part of the reason is we don't build these things as well as we should so that's a lesson for American Technology and business absolutely NASA the defense agencies they should not have to depend on one company do you know that all Communications uh big big communication satellite even for our intelligence agencies that have to go into high Earth orbit they're done by SpaceX they launch it because NASA and Boeing have become somewhat sclerotic and what about even this week as he meets with Kim Jong-un President Putin praise musk Great American businessman a great citizen of the world does that bother musk that this you know active imperialistic aggression as is being described you know he's talking to the aggressors and maybe getting a little a little bit of context for his starlink availability from what the Russians say this idea of starting World War III is that really a concern right now well musk had some of an apocalyptic Vision as he often does of what can happen and you talk to the Russian Ambassador the thing though to remember is when Russia invades Ukraine that night Ukraine has no way to communicate with its troops via SATs out all the other satellites out the only way to communicate would be starlink and musk rushes hundreds and then thousands of starlinked terminals over there for free as a donation so he's supporting the ukrainians but at a certain point he says to me how did I get into this war you know I didn't mean for this to be useful offensive purposes [Music] foreign", "

EXPERTS. MAJORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER CALLED IN THE BIGGEST NAMES IN TECH FOR A BIPARTISAN ON HOW LAWMAKERS CAN ACCELERATE AI DEVELOPMENT. >> IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE A REFEREE JUST AS YOU HAVE A REFEREE IN A SPORTS GAME OR ALL SPORTS GAMES AND THE GAME IS BETTER FOR IT. THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR CIVILIZATION. THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS WILL NOT BE JUMPING INTO THE DEEP END AND MAKING RULES. BUT IT STARTS WITH INSIGHT. >> Reporter: LET'S BRING IN CBS NEWS SENIOR BUSINESS AND TECH CORRESPONDENT JOLINE KENT. SO WHAT IF IT'S NOT JUMPING INTO THE DEEP END AS ELON SAID, WHAT ARE THE ACTUAL ISSUES? WHAT ARE THE MAIN KIND OF BIG ISSUES THAT ARE AT STAKE RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF REGULATING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE? >> THE BIG TOPICS THAT WERE DISCUSSED BETWEEN THESE POWERFUL CEOs THESE BILLIONAIRES AND SENATORS TODAY WERE REALLY FOCUSED AROUND SAFETY AND THE PACE OF DEVELOPMENT OF AI. BECAUSE SO MUCH OF WHAT'S DEVELOPED BY AI SCIENTISTS AND RESEARCHERS CAN THEN GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND DO THINGS THAT MAYBE THEY WEREN'T EVEN AWARE AI COULD DO. FOR EXAMPLE PASS THE MCAT OR DO ALL KINDS OF TASKS THAT AI COULDN'T EVEN DO A YEAR AGO. SO IT'S ABOUT MOVING QUICKLY, AND MAXIMIZING THE UPSIDE WHILE MINIMIZING THE POSSIBLE DOWNSIDE OF JOB ELIMINATION THAT SO MANY OF THESE SENATORS OF BOTH SIDES ARE SO CONCERNED ABOUT. THE OTHER ISSUE THAT CAME UP WAS THE FACT THERE'S CONCERN ABOUT CHINA LEADING THE WAY AND BEING AHEAD OF THE GAME AND BEING ABLE TO SET THE GLOBAL STANDARD. AND SENATORS ARE HOPING THAT THEY CAN ESTABLISH DIALOGUE AND THEN REGULATION THAT ALLOWS FOR LOTS OF INVASION GOING FORWARD. BUT ALSO THE SAFEGUARDS TO PROTECT PEOPLE AS THEY USE AI WITHOUT LOSING TO CHINA. SO THAT'S A VERY TALL ORDER. SENATOR SCHUMER TOLD ME TODAY THEY EXPECT THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL MEETINGS OF THIS KIND. BUT WE HOPE THAT THERE'LL BE OPEN PRESS. THE DOORS WERE CLOSED TODAY. UNFORTUNATELY. >> YES, WELL, THEY DO THAT SOMETIMES. >> THEY DO. >> EVEN THOUGH THE DOORS WERE CLOSED WAS THERE DISCUSSION ABOUT LEGISLATION TO TRY TO REGULATE AI OR WAS THERE ANY TALK OF CREATING AN FCC OR OTHER KIND OF FEDERAL AGENCY THAT WOULD MANAGE THESE KINDS OF ISSUES. >> THERE WAS DISCUSSION ACCORDING TO ELON MUSK AS WELL AS SENATOR SCHUMER OF A NEW ENTITY TO REGULATE AI. SENATOR SCHUMER WAS VERY QUICK TO SAY, IT'S TOO SOON TO TALK ABOUT THAT. THAT THEY'RE VERY MUCH IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PHASE WHEN IT COME S TO FIGURING OUT WHAT LEGISLATURE WILL LOOK LIKE. THERE ARE A LOT OF IDEAS, YOU KNOW BEING WORKED OUT HERE IN WASHINGTON. BUT THE IDEA OF AN ADDITIONAL ENTITY IS CERTAINLY MET WITH A LOT OF RESISTANCE, BUT SOME TECH EXPERTS AND SOURCES THAT I'VE BEEN TALKING TO OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS ARE TO THAT. WHEN ALL OF THE CEOs WERE ASKED SHOULD THERE BE NEW TECH AND ALL OF THEM RAISED THEIR HAND. >> WHAT IS YOUR THINKING GIVING THE RECORDING OF THE TECH COMPANIES. WHAT IS THE MENTAL VIEW OF CREATING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BECAUSE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO REGULATE WHAT THEY DO. HOW DO THEY SAY ABOUT THIS PARTNERSHIP WITH THE GOVERNMENT. >> THEY SAY THEY WANT TO BE HELP. IN CREATING THAT LEGISLATION. AND THEY'RE OPEN TO IT AND THEY ENCOURAGE IT. IF YOU LOOK AT CONGRESS'S TRACK RECORD OVER THE LAST 5, 10 YEARS THERE'S BEEN MANY HEARINGS IN WHICH GOOGLE OR MARK ZUCKERBERG FROM META NOW, THERE'S BEEN VERY LITTLE LEGISLATION. WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS MAYBE A LITTLE MORE  COLLABORATION. SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE TRYING TO CREATE TRUST BETWEEN THE TECH CEO AND LAWMAKERS. SO THEY'RE LOOKIN", "'/watch?v=Xw9gc-vGe6o&pp=ygUJRWxvbiBNdXNr'": "A new Elon Musk biography calls Amber Heard\u00a0\neverything from \"chaotic evil\" to \"toxic.\"\u00a0\u00a0 But does the tech entrepreneur\u00a0\nshare those views on his ex? In addition to her short marriage to Johnny\u00a0\nDepp, Amber Heard was also involved in\u00a0\u00a0 another high-profile relationship with Elon\u00a0\nMusk. According to Heard, she and Musk first\u00a0\u00a0 started talking at the 2016 Met Gala. Heard\u00a0\nsaid about meeting Musk for the first time: \"He seemed like a real gentleman.\u00a0\nHe was really nice. He sat at a\u00a0\u00a0 nearby table and we got to speaking that\u00a0\nnight and eventually became friends.\" Heard and the Tesla founder eventually started\u00a0\ndating before breaking up for the first time\u00a0\u00a0 in 2017. The couple attempted to rekindle\u00a0\ntheir romance before finally breaking up for\u00a0\u00a0 good in 2018. While speaking about her breakup\u00a0\nwith Musk, Heard told The Hollywood Reporter: \"Elon and I had a beautiful relationship,\u00a0\u00a0 and we have a beautiful friendship now,\u00a0\none that was based on our core values.\" While Elon Musk remains cordial\u00a0\nwhen speaking about Heard, those\u00a0\u00a0 closest to him are not afraid of holding\u00a0\nback. In Walter Isaacson's biography,\u00a0\u00a0 titled \"Elon Musk,\" Elon's brother\u00a0\nKimbal stated this about Heard, \"She was just so toxic. A nightmare.\" Meanwhile, Elon's chief of staff told Isaacson: \"She was like the Joker in Batman. She didn't have\u00a0\u00a0 a goal or aim other than chaos. She\u00a0\nthrives on destabilizing everything.\" \"I don't know if I could have it any other way.\" Isaacson also detailed Musk\u00a0\nand Heard's tumultuous fights,\u00a0\u00a0 which included the actor locking herself\u00a0\nin a room and claiming she was afraid of\u00a0\u00a0 being attacked. Kimball went\u00a0\non to tell Musk's biographer: \"She really is a very good actress so\u00a0\nshe will say things that you're like:\u00a0\u00a0 'Wow, maybe she's telling you\u00a0\nthe truth,' but she isn't.\" Furthermore, Musk's ex-girlfriend Grimes, who\u00a0\nis also the mother of three of his children,\u00a0\u00a0 compared Heard to a Dungeons & Dragons\u00a0\ncharacter, calling her \"chaotic evil.\" Musk and Heard's relationship began in a sketchy\u00a0\nway, seeing as the actor was still married to\u00a0\u00a0 Johnny Depp when she and Musk reportedly got\u00a0\ntogether. During Heard and Depp's legal battle,\u00a0\u00a0 Depp accused his ex-wife of having\u00a0\nan affair with Musk just one month\u00a0\u00a0 after they were married. According to the\u00a0\nfiling, Depp alleged that Musk visited his\u00a0\u00a0 then-wife late at night at their Los Angeles\u00a0\napartment multiple times. Depp also alleged\u00a0\u00a0 that during one of those visits by Musk,\u00a0\nHeard was seen with bruises on her face. During Depp's lawsuit against The Sun In 2020,\u00a0\na staff member of their building stated that\u00a0\u00a0 she had seen Heard with marks on her body in\u00a0\nthe summer of 2016. The employee also said\u00a0\u00a0 she saw Musk leave the building right before\u00a0\nshe witnessed Heard with bruises on her body. However, Musk took to Twitter to\u00a0\nrefute the claims that he visited\u00a0\u00a0 Heard at the penthouse while she\u00a0\nand Depp were together, writing, \"This is false. JD's team put out\u00a0\n'video evidence,' but conveniently\u00a0\u00a0 excluded the date stamp, as it was\u00a0\nwell after JD & AH had separated.\" In July 2021, Amber Heard announced that she had\u00a0\u00a0 recently welcomed a baby girl.\u00a0\nThe actress shared on Instagram: \"Four years ago, I decided I wanted to have\u00a0\na child. I wanted to do it on my own terms.\u00a0\u00a0 I now appreciate how radical it is for us\u00a0\nas women to think about one of the most\u00a0\u00a0 fundamental parts of our destinies\u00a0\nin this way. I hope we arrive at a\u00a0\u00a0 point in which it's normalized to not\u00a0\nwant a ring in order to have a crib.\" While Heard has remained quiet about\u00a0\nthe identity of her daughter's father,\u00a0\u00a0 Radar has reported that she and Musk were \"in\u00a0\na legal battle\" over frozen embryos. In legal\u00a0\u00a0 documents from The Sun trial that were obtained by\u00a0\nthe site, Heard's friend Jennifer Howell told the\u00a0\u00a0 court that Elon Musk wanted to get rid of the\u00a0\nembryos. But according to Howell, Heard wanted\u00a0\u00a0 to use them to get pregnant. If this is true,\u00a0\nHeard's daughter would be Musk's twelfth child."}
