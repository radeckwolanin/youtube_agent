goodness he's caught five balls in the opening drive it's a nice job by the quarterback here he gets pressure even though it's only four but then again being decisive shows you that athletic ability Wilson emotion Etna has a handoff you hit a first down and he's stripped up at the 25 but a quick burst from the sophomore for Jennings Louisiana watch 67 left guard get up to that linebacker right there that close that hole closed in a hurry [Applause] etn will be swarmed to the backfield and they are excellent at invading Aaron Beasley has been a wrecking crew look at those formations create vertical seams for those home run shots downfield foot to the wrist caught then rolling down to the 10-yard line is squirrel white the electric slot receiver and the balls threatening quickly and here's that screen that set it up look at John the job Brew McCoy does very tough on that defensive back Mitchell a safety Milton for the End Zone card touchdown Ramel Keaton and the volunteers right down the field to draw first blood so he gets separation and then they go right to Keaton who had the big play last year in this game a turning point touchdown Harry gets the first score of the night six plays 71 yards in two minutes Gators offense at Utah in the loss got a touchdown in the second half etn picks his way follows his block and burst still going he ended a foot race and he'll win it touchdown Gators the block right here he's just gonna follow him around but I also wants you to watch the free safety who's got to clean this up it's a nice game but as the free safety comes up right here he's got to make this tackle you're gonna give up eight to ten yards but you can't Olay and miss him then a missed tackle there by Haddon and Away etn goes offensive line good job of polling nice job of picking up that closing defensive end by James Pierce there's the missed tackle two missed tackles at the end low Center gravity he's going to run through if you're going to wrap him up he's going to run through just a trying to hit him to bring him down in that first drive there had some issues second and nine pitch to The Edge catch made slipping The Tackle his squirrel White and the squirrel is loose near the 43. just a bit erratic in these first few weeks man he looks really comfortable in this offense sure does if there's somebody on the move here pump fake he just takes off oh he got the defender to bite and that's what earns him the first down in the scramble you don't think that'll calm the fan base down [Applause] merch still got it oh he wanted to take a shot downfield never got a chance as he was leveled by big Bryson Easton off this play action look one of the things they try to do is see if the safeties will come in you can see good job by McCullough getting back to take anything away downfield young talent in the pipeline on defense but a very experienced group nine senior starters Mertz on Third and 12 on the Move flings it and tightroping and making a great catch in the sidelines is Khalil Jackson the first possession [Applause] exploding again what a night trevorizian is having great job of blocking here by Hayden Hanson 89 he's got no one to pick up initially so he goes up to that next level and I'm not going to tell you you get etn a chance to get downhill low center of gravity physical back 205 pounds what a great job here of just feeling this looks like this plays design inside and then he bounces it right there I mean look at that cut you got two ball Defenders trying to work outside and gets underneath him and then into the end zone there's working so hard to not let him get outside and he shows you how quickly he can cut back the only three guys dressed in those colors here tonight Milton Under Pressure it is he throws just loves it up and it's an interception there's a flag down where the quarterback was hit meanwhile Devin Moore rolling into the secondary takes it down inside the 20. we'll see if the interception stands and is able to lean on the quarterback Milton just puts it up in the air it's almost like a punt an easy interception merch sneaks it doesn't even need much of a push no signal yet touchdown helmet came off from the scrum but it's merts who emerges with a rushing touchdown you're getting okay watch The Right Guard here good job of pushing makes it easy for Mertz to get in there what was interesting is Mark's a pretty mild mannered guy and we saw him at Wisconsin I keep talking about how he's fitting in in this offense winning this team over look at him coming off this sideline you don't think he's doing this right now and being aggressive and getting those first downs and getting the tempo going it's tougher to do on the road than at kneeling Tyreke South got him the pressure ends up getting home here but look at both sides they're not bringing backers here they're just taking advantage of a good get off get him going reverse the running game is going that's another first down in the Tennessee territory they cannot tackle two or seven so far have a lot to do with the result of the play Mertz hooks it to Johnson and a long way to go set to tackle still running makes a tight and scores foreign they've been using the counter play right here right pulling around watch the design of this play and watch the watch the motion and watch how Tennessee has a lot to think about are they running the counter are they running a boo and then watch the quarterback patiently draw the defense to him and then they go screen out to the right just a great job again in the execution Mertz baiting this defense looking left and at the last second gets it out to Johnson we've been talking a lot about etn this is why this Duo is so dangerous in Gainesville also learn to know Josh hyper said they've got to be better on early Downs like this lost the football he falls on it these are the guys that have to win in the slot looking to the right and he finds castles big Phillips running hard and it's a pickup on Third and long thank you and he cuts into this lead 13 play drive right back to him great job of this time Thornton look at that throat by the way that throw right over the outside shoulder they swung into the backfield Scooby Williams busts in and stops right and the Gators come up with a turnover on down Kingsley iguakun the center-back has been important for sure DTM makes a cut flip the tackle in the open lowers the shoulder first and goal Gators Beasley prevented a touchdown mother Travis appreciates this watch this the leakage right there he bounces off of that arm tackle bounces off of that arm tackle great lateral so it's third and goal tough to throw it in down here let's see what merch dials up now he's going to try to keep it and he's knocked down so pretty conservative Kirk when they want to get that first and goal and he does his job to the Gators add three to the lead playing with Tempo Milton Under Pressure launches down cut touchdown Brew McCoy and the volunteers still alive we talked about which of these receivers can make a play plenty of time good job actually moving away from that pressure [Music] and McCoy able to pull away from the true freshman the lead is 13. and the violence offense on the field to go for two again across the middle throws a dart making the catch is Ramel Keaton Gators Rush four Milton escapes across the middle it's a low throw incomplete could not complete It On the Run Scooby Williams was chasing him and another fourth down stop for this Florida defense tonight the first one pressures right here and the second one's a spy it's a good plan here he's only rushed three they bring the linebacker now you got a spy right there really affected I think the timing of what Milton tried to do buying time Scooby Williams hits him he can see the ball is low and that'll do it the Gators win it 29-16 [Applause] unless hypel chose now to stop the clock with seven seconds to go okay okay so in fourth and 16 they'll run around as the clock ticks down and now get knocked down as he took a knee the flag comes out and that is a fitting ending to things here we go yeah this is about to get ugly look at this guys are throwing Fists Josh heupel calling this time out and then the late hit yeah this is unfortunate yeah he was taking a knee it was obvious what he was doing and he got knocked into and of course the gator offensive line took Exception by the way it's a 15-yard penalty you know it it's kind of fitting for how this game has gone for Tennessee [Music]"}
