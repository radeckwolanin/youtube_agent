MORE AND MORE POLLING SHOWS GROWING VOTERS CONCERN ABOUT HIS AGE, HIS SON, IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY, RUNNING MATE AND THEIR POOR APPROVAL RATINGS. NBC NEWS AND NOW THE \"WASHINGTON POST\" ARE TAKING NOTE. THE POST WITH THIS HEADLINE. ANXIETY RIPPLES THROUGH THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY OVER BIDEN. SENATOR TED CRUZ WITH THIS PREDICTION OF WHAT'S ON TAP. >> IN AUGUST OF 2024, THE DEMOCRAT KING MAKERS JETTISON JOE BIDEN AND PARACHUTE IN MICHELLE OBAMA. BARACK OBAMA IS ALREADY RUNNING THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. I THINK HE IS ALREADY THE PUPPET MASTER. I THINK THE ODDS OF MICHELLE OBAMA PARACHUTING IN IN AUGUST OF 2024 HAVE RISEN DRAMATICALLY. >> Harris: LET'S CHECK THAT AND DEBATE. SEAN DUFFY, CO-HOST OF THE BOTTOM LINE ON FBN. KEVIN WALLING FORMER BIDEN CAMPAIGN SURROGATE. GREAT TO SEE YOU BOTH. KEVIN, AS THE DEMOCRAT ON THE PANEL, WHAT DO YOU THINK? WILL SHE PARACHUTE? >> GOOD MORNING. TED CRUZ SHOULD SPEND LESS TIME PODCASTING AND TRYING TO FUND THE GOVERNMENT. THAT ASIDE, YOU KNOW, BARACK OBAMA NOT PULLING THE STRINGS. JOE BIDEN HAS AN 81% APPROVAL RATING AMONG DEMOCRATS. DONALD TRUMP JUST HAS A 66% APPROVAL RATING AMONG REPUBLICANS. DEMOCRATS LOVE TO WRING OUR HANDS AND COMPLAIN AND LOVE TO SAY WOE IS ME. WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS FALL IN LINE AND SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT AND THE VICE PRESIDENT WHO HAS SUCCESSFULLY STEERED THIS COUNTRY OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS. >> Harris: YOU THINK YOU CAN GET HIS POLLING NUMBERS WAY UNDER WATER WITH THE REST OF THE UNITED STATES? YOU LOOK AT ONE POLL. >> WE'LL SURE TRY. >> Harris: REGISTERED VOTERS 60% ARE AGAINST HIM AND HER. THOSE BIG FAT NUMBERS. SO YOU THINK YOU CAN TURN IT AROUND? INTERESTING. SEAN. >> JOE BIDEN HAD A 95% APPROVAL RATING A YEAR AGO. THAT IS HORRIBLE 81%. OVERALL HE SITS 45%. HE SITS IN THE OVAL OFFICE AND GOES ON VACATION AND LISTENS TO ADVISORS. WE KNOW WHO WON RACES, YOU HAVE TO BE ON THE STREETS AND GET VOTER'S FEEDBACK. THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE IS ECONOMY AND INFLATION. WE DON'T CARE ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND TRANS BOYS COMPETING AGAINST GIRLS IN SPORTS. IF JOE DID THAT. I THINK HE LOSES IN NOVEMBER OF 2024 BUT MUCH CLOSER. RIGHT NOW THE WAY IT'S GOING DEMOCRATS HAVE TO LOOK FOR AN ESCAPE VALVE. WHETHER IT'S MICHELLE OBAMA OR GAVIN NEWSOM SOMEONE WHO GETS TO THE 48 OR 50% RANGE OF A CANDIDATE WHO CAN WIN AN ELECTION. NOT JOE BIDEN. HE IS FAILING. >> Harris: WE'RE BACK TO TED CRUZ AND HIS THEORY OF PEOPLE PARACHUTING IN. WE'LL COVER EVERY SECOND. SENATORS ARE FOCUSED ON THE IMPORTANT STUFF, IN QUOTES. IT'S NOT TRUE. SOUNDING OFF OVER MAJORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER'S RELAXING THE CHAMBER'S DRESS CODE. THERE IS A MIX OF OUTRAGE AND MOCKERY ALONG WITH REAL CONCERNS ABOUT RESPECT AND DECORUM. >> I SAT OFTEN THE COMMITTEE WITH JOHN FETTERMAN AND SAW HIM IN A SUIT ONE. DISRESPECTFUL FOR THE PEOPLE WHO PUT THEM IN A POSITION. >> ANOTHER STEP IN THE MOVEMENT BY THE DEMOCRATS TO TRANSFORM AMERICA. TAKE US TO A DIFFERENT PLACE AND TO A PLACE MUCH LESS RESPECTFUL THAN HISTORICALLY WE HAVE BEEN. >> I PLAN TO WEAR A BIKINI TOMORROW TO THE SENATE FLOOR. TO DO AWAY WITH THE DRESS CODE, TO ME DEBASES THE INSTITUTION. >> Harris: I HOPE NOT. I HOPE SHE IS NOT IN A BIKINI. KEVIN. >> I'M NOT THE RIGHT PERSON TO ANSWER THIS. I'M NOT THE BIGGEST FAN OF THE HOODIE. IT IS SILLY TO HEAR THIS CONDEMNATION FROM THE REPUBLICANS FALLING IN LINE BEHIND A PRESIDENT, A FORMER PRESIDENT WHO INSPIRED A MOB IN THE WORDS OF MITCH MCCONNELL AND KEVIN MCCARTHY THAT DESECRATED THE CAPITOL. I  THINK -- INSTEAD OF WORRYING ABOUT A GUY IN A HOODIE. >> GIVE ME A BREAK. I WORE JEANS ON THE HOUSE FLOOR BACK IN THE CLOAK ROOM. THE GREATEST DELIBERATIVE BODY IT WAS. TO HAVE A SENATOR DRESSED LIKE A HIGH SCHOOL BOY ON A SATURDAY MORNING IS RIDICULOUS. YOU DON'T GO TO A HEARING OR SPEAK AT THE SENATE CHAMBER DRESSED LIKE THAT. IT DEBASES THE BODY. SHAME ON THE SENATE AND CHUCK SCHUMER. GET SOME DECORUM. WEAR A SUIT AND TIE. >> Harris: I WANT THEM TO PUT ON SOME USA MUSCLE SHIRTS AND GO TO THE BORDER AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON AND COVER SOMETHING IN THE SENATE THAT REALLY MATTERS. >> I BET SEAN LOOKED GOOD IN THE JEANS. >>"}
